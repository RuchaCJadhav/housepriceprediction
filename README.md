# Housepriceprediction

Description:
In our quest for finding a new house, we often encounter challenges such as fraudulent listings, negotiations, and extensive research on local areas. To address these issues, we introduce a Machine Learning-based solution for House Price Prediction.

Overview:
This project aims to develop a predictive model using Machine Learning techniques, specifically trained on the House Price Prediction Dataset. By leveraging advanced algorithms, we seek to provide accurate estimates of house prices, empowering individuals in making informed decisions during their house-hunting journey.

Features:
Utilizes Machine Learning algorithms for predictive analysis.
Trained on a comprehensive dataset for house price prediction.
